# cactiDash

Reducing the need to rage at cacti, while still making use of its highly
configurable graphing back-end.

## Description

cactiDash is a single html file (for now) which displays graphs of interest
from a Cacti back-end in a grid-like layout. It was created to present on a
secondary display for elegant and manageable monitoring of many servers at once.

While it was made primarily for my own benefit, it should be easy enough to configure
it in any way you want, changing which graphs are displayed, assigning specific
graphing periods per-graph, and adding more servers.

If you wish to make use of this and are not sure of a certain element, or would like
further features added, please don't hesitate to fork or file an issue.
